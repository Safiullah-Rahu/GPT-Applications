## GPT-3 Text Generator Streamlit App

This script uses the python library Streamlit to create a user interface for a text generation application that utilizes the OpenAI GPT-3 language model. It imports the OpenAI library and sets the API key to access the GPT-3 model. A function is defined to generate text using the GPT-3 model, taking in a user-inputted prompt and returning the generated text. The Streamlit UI includes a title, a text input field for the prompt, and a button to trigger the text generation. When the button is pressed, the result of the text generation is displayed in the UI.
